# hyrax-ansible
Ansible playbook for configuring a Hyrax IR.

It is hoped that this script will be a starting point for teams running Hyrax-based IRs in production.
The idea is similar to https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/claw-playbook

All roles assume services (Nginx, Fedora 4, PostgreSQL) are installed on one machine and communicate using UNIX sockets or the loopback interface. For large deployments, you'll want to edit these roles so that services are deployed on different machines and that communication between them is encrypted.

These roles do not create the default collection types, the default administrative set and the default load workflows. See [#17](/../../issues/17). Run these commands after running the playbook:

```sh
sudo su hyrax
cd /var/www/hyrax/hyrax-root/
export RAILS_ENV="production"
/usr/local/bin/bundle exec rails hyrax:default_collection_types:create
/usr/local/bin/bundle exec rails hyrax:default_admin_set:create
/usr/local/bin/bundle exec rails hyrax:workflow:load
```

These roles also do not create admin users or any work types. See https://github.com/samvera/hyrax#generate-a-work-type and https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Making-Admin-Users-in-Hyrax.

The `hyrax` role assumes that an external SMTP server will be used. Some environments might want to use use a local mail transfer agent. To do so, the `production.rb` template will need to be changed. More information can be found in the Hyrax management guide: https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Hyrax-Management-Guide#mailers.

This playbook is being tested against CentOS 7, Debian 9, and Ubuntu 18.04. A Vagrantfile is available at https://github.com/cu-library/hyrax-ansible-testvagrants.

`install_hyrax_on_localhost.yml` is a test playbook which runs the provided roles against localhost.

What does production-ready mean? A production ready instance of Hyrax should be secure. It should be regularly backed-up. It should be easy to update. Finally, it should have good performance.

## Security

INCOMPLETE

The services running within the VM should ensure data is protected from unauthorized access and modification. If one were to gain access to a nonprivileged Linux user account, one should not be able to access or modify any IR data. *Currently, this is not true of these roles. Some services are available to any Linux user.*

Attacks like remote code execution, XSS, SQL injection should be mitigated. Remote users should not be able to read or alter the filesystem in unexpected ways. *These roles still need a more thorough review against these types of attacks.*

## Backups

NEEDS TESTING, FEEDBACK WELCOME

The `hyrax` role has three backup scripts. They are copied to the /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly directories, so the exact time they run is dependent on the distribution and system configuration.

Daily, Fedora 4 repository data (using the `fcr:backup` REST endpoint), PostgreSQL data (using `pg_dumpall`), the Redis `/var/lib/redis/dump.rdb` file and the Hyrax root directory are copied, tar'd together, and compressed. The resulting backup file has a datestamp and a MD5 checksum added to the filename. The daily backups reside in the `hyrax_backups_directory`/daily directory. As well as performing the backup, the daily backup script deletes any files in the daily directory that are older than 7 days old.

Weekly, a script moves the oldest daily backup to the `hyrax_backups_directory`/weekly directory. The weekly script also deletes files in the weekly directory that are older than 31 days old.

Monthly, a script moves the oldest weekly backup to the `hyrax_backups_directory`/monthly directory. The weekly script also deletes files in the monthly directory that are older than 365 days old.

For large deployments, this amount of backups might overwhelm local storage. It is recommended that the backup schedule and retention periods be tailored for your deployment.

It is up to local system administrators to copy backup data to a NAS or SAN, tape, or to cloud storage like Amazon Glacier or OLRC.

## Updates

INCOMPLETE

Where possible, it should be easy to keep a production server up-to-date. This means these roles should utilize well-known package repositories and package management tools when possible. Roles should be as idempotent and 'low impact' as possible, to encourage system administrators to run them regularly. Local modifications to community code should be minimal. These roles should not overwrite local changes and customizations. These roles do not create admin users, work types, administrative sets or load workflows.

## Performance

INCOMPLETE

These roles should install Hyrax so that it has good performance (max 500ms for most requests) on a "medium sized" server (4 core, 4GB RAM) when being used for typical workloads (documents and images, some multimedia, less than 10,000 digital objects). Community recommended software versions and configuration should be used.

## Software versions

Some software in the provided roles is installed using yum or apt from the default distribution repositories. The software version will depend on the distribution and release. For example, version 7 or 8 of Tomcat might be installed. For Java, OpenJDK version 8 is used.

Nginx is installed using that project's pre-built packages for the stable version, and not the default distribution repositories.

Node.js latest version 10.x is installed using the NodeSource repositories.

Some software is installed at a specific version:

* Fedora Repository {{ fedora4_version }} (Set using `fedora4_version` variable.)
* Solr {{ solr_version }} (Set using `solr_version` variable.)
* Ruby {{ ruby_version }} (Set using `ruby_version` variable.)
* FFmpeg {{ ffmpeg_version }} (Set using `ffmpeg_version` variable.)
* Rails {{ rails_version }} (Set using `rails_version` variable.)
* Hyrax {{ hyrax_version }} (Set using `hyrax_version` variable.)
* FITS {{ fits_version }} (Set using `fits_version` variable.)

FFmpeg is built with:

* cmake: {{ cmake_version }} (Set using `cmake_version` variable.)
* NASM {{ nasm_version }} (Set using `nasm_version` variable.)
* Yasm {{ yasm_version }} (Set using `yasm_version` variable.)
* x264: {{ x264_version }} (Set using `x264_version` variable.)
* x265: {{ x265_version }} (Set using `x265_version` variable.)
* fdk-aac: {{ fdk_aac_version }} (Set using `fdk_aac_version` variable.)
* lame: {{ lame_version }} (Set using `lame_version` variable.)
* opus: {{ opus_version }} (Set using `opus_version` variable.)
* libogg: {{ libogg_version }} (Set using `libogg_version` variable.)
* libvorbis: {{ libvorbis_version }} (Set using `libvorbis_version` variable.)
* aom: {{ aom_version }} (Set using `aom_version` variable.) Falling back to using a commit instead of a tagged release. The tarballs from https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/ are generated when requested for a particular tag. They are not stable releases, and as such do not have stable checksums. A checksum is not provided.
* libvpx: {{ libvpx_version }} (Set using `libvpx_version` variable.)
* libass: {{ libass_version }} (Set using `libass_version` variable.)

**Per-Distro**: Different value for different OSs. The test playbook uses

```
vars_files:
    - "vars/common.yml"
    - "vars/{{ ansible_distribution }}.yml"
```

and per-distribution variable files to provide different variables for different distributions.

**Secure**: Variables which should be different per-host and stored securely using Ansible Vaults or a tool like Hashicorp Vault. The test playbook insecurely puts these variables in `vars/common.yml`.
